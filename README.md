# AgencyOf Software Engineer Code Challenge

You will be given a small design for a section of a random website. This design was generated entirely for this code challenge, and is not associated to any AgencyOf clients. The purpose of this code challenge is to assess the applicant's ability to take a finished high-fidelity design and deliver a functional website from it. This challenge represents the basic day-to-day development an AgencyOf contractor/employee will do regardless of skill level.    


## Please do the following:
* Create a website application using HTML/CSS and Javascript to develop an interactive version of the given design section.  

* The web application can be done with any framework or library of your choosing, but worth knowing that our main stack at AgencyOf is ReactJS and Next.js. For example - you are free to use React/Angular/Vue/jQuery/etc… as well as any UI frameworks you want to use like Bootstrap/Tailwind/etc…  

* Bonus points go to: how closely you match the design, responsiveness of the design (is it mobile friendly?) and clever use of coding libraries (are you overusing a library or re-inventing the wheel?).  

* Additional points go to any considerations in regards to interactivity – for example, if you wanted to go further than just a static design you can set up hover/onclick/etc… events on things like the stars/images/etc…  

* We estimate a basic version of this would take ~30 minutes to put together, but welcome applicants to take as much time as they want.  

* This is "take-home" style with no deadline for delivery; another interview round will be scheduled after repository is shared.  

* Generate a repository with your code & share the repo with us for review.  

* Be prepared to spend 30 minutes in a second round of interviews to discuss the challenge where we will dissect bits of your code with more detail.  

## Resources Provided
In the archived folder named "Code Challenge" you'll see a set of images. These are assets that have been exported from the design and can be used in your project. You are also given the a PNG export of the design itself. Alongside all of that you have [a prototype of the design available on InvisionApp](https://alexandertash827675.invisionapp.com/console/share/CH304RSJQ4/758453512).    

If you are able to open Sketch files and would like the Sketch file used for this project feel free to ask Alex Tash @ AgencyOf (alex@agencyof.com) for that file.
